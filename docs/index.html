        <div style="text-align: justify;">
            <p>
                I am a recent graduate with an M.Sc. in Computer Science from <b>McGill University</b>, where I conducted research under <i>Prof. Doina Precup</i> at <b>Mila</b>. My work focused on drug discovery using Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), leading to publications at ICML and NeurIPS in 2023.
            </p>
            <p>
                Previously, I spent three years at Shell as a software engineer, working on NLP chatbots and document classifiers with bi-directional LSTMs.
            </p>
            <p>
                My skills include creating classifiers with Vision Transformers (ViTs), developing reinforcement learning agents, and applying machine learning to medical diagnostics. I’ve also developed Power BI dashboards for real-time analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of work, I enjoy playing badminton, squash, cricket, and tennis. I’m passionate about using machine learning to tackle real-world challenges and am excited to explore new opportunities in this field.

                                        Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms aim to learn an optimal policy by iteratively sampling actions to learn how to maximize the total expected return, R(x). GFlowNets are a special class of algorithms designed to generate diverse candidates, x, from a discrete set, by learning a policy that approximates the proportional sampling of R(x). GFlowNets exhibit improved mode discovery compared to conventional RL algorithms, which is very useful for applications such as drug discovery and combinatorial search. However, since GFlowNets are a relatively recent class of algorithms, many techniques which are useful in RL have not yet been associated with them. In this paper, we study the utilization of a replay buffer for GFlowNets. We explore empirically various replay buffer sampling techniques and assess the impact on the speed of mode discovery and the quality of the modes discovered. Our experimental results in the Hypergrid toy domain and a molecule synthesis environment demonstrate significant improvements in mode discovery when training with a replay buffer, compared to training only with trajectories generated on-policy.

                                        Deep learning is emerging as an effective tool in drug discovery, with potential applications in both predictive and generative models. Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets/GFNs) are a recently introduced method recognized for the ability to generate diverse candidates, in particular in small molecule generation tasks. In this work, we introduce double GFlowNets (DGFNs). Drawing inspiration from reinforcement learning and Double Deep Q-Learning, we introduce a target network used to sample trajectories, while updating the main network with these sampled trajectories. Empirical results confirm that DGFNs effectively enhance exploration in sparse reward domains and high-dimensional state spaces, both challenging aspects of de-novo design in drug discovery.
